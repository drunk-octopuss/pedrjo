# **Patricks** server
---
## <u>Why?</u>
This project was created in order to learn how to create a basic CRUD server as well as how    
to use it with [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) in order to interact with it.

### <u>CRUD?</u>
C)reate  
R)ead  
U)pdate  
D)elete

### <u>Designed purpose</u>

My server was designed to handle books, for example: 

```json  

{  
    "bookAuthor": "Leo Tolstoy",
    "bookTitle": "War and Peace",
    "bookYear": 1867
}  

```

...as well as the possibility to manipulate these (with the help of [uuid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid)) in ways that a CRUD server is supposed to.
